Question they'll ask:
- Questions générales (pas ciblées)
- Comment on a réparti le travail ?
- Montrer Insertion / Deletion
- What were the challenges, what was interesting
- Interfaces, Choix...
- What we liked we liked or not...


Problems we had:
- CSV importation (Quotes character..)
- Tables from CSV importation
	- Request worked on small tables but not on fat ones -> Couldn't test all queries
		(typically has_recorded)


Problems and Ameliorations:
- We chose to have a local solution instead of a distant one -> lots of problem of synchronisation between team members (git..). Amelioration : works on distant server
- Noticed the lack of optimability of our diagram at the end of the project. Amelioration : Improve diagram with some other paths.
